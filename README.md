# Website Optimization Project

### About The Project

This project is based on Website Performance Optimization. It consists of two parts 
```
1. PageSpeedInsights Score
2. 60 fps Project

```
The first part of the project optimizes a webpage's initial load time whereas the second part of the project focuses on optimizing the animations
to run smoothly at 60fps. This project emphasizes on the concept of reducing the critical rendering path and doing away with unncessary blocks of 
code which affect performance. Get ready to optimize!!

### Getting Started

To analyse the PageSpeedScore of index.html for initial load times which covers the first part of the project you should obtain a URL.This can be done by setting up a simple HTTP server using python or hosting the website on github pages.Refer to the following links for detailed information on both of these methods
1. [Setting up a simple HTTP Python server](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/)
2. [Hosting a webpage using github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)
3. [As an alternative, you can also use ngrok to test your webpage](https://www.sitepoint.com/use-ngrok-test-local-site/)

### Notes 

Since this webpage has been optimized on the chrome browser, I recommend you to use the same for further testing, reviewing and optimisation
